        <strong>Instructions: </strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the link below to open our dialog data collection interface.</li>
            <li>Modify "Starting address" on the left side of the page to a nearby landmark in your city.</li>
            <li>Think of 5 places in your city where you might take a taxi trip to. This can be a specific destination or a general type of place.</li>
            <li>Talk to the agent to convey to them the destination you have in mind.</li>
            <li>Ask questions about the destination until you are satisfied that the agent is taking you to the right place. The agent may take a few seconds to reply.</li>
            <li>When the agent ends a dialog, you will see a map showing the destination. Select whether the destination was correct or not.</li>
            <li>The conversation will clear, and a new one will start. Continue until you have finished 5 dialogs with 5 different destinations.</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT: Come back to this page and submit the task.</li>
